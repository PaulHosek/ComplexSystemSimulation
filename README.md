# ComplexSystemSimulation

#### Installation

#### How to run

Just run `server.py` file. It will open mesa board in your browser. You will see charts there of the simulation.
The server has some sliders, that can be used to change the initial model parameters. Its effects can only be seen after the model has
been restarted (the reset button on top of the browser has been pressed).

Regarding the Sensitivity Analysis, run the `sensitivity_analysis.py` file. This will produce the results and plots 
of the sensitivity analysis techniques used. 

In order to see the results of the conducted experiments, run the `run_experiments.py` file. You will see plots 
with the results of the experiments.
